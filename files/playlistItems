Their music is fierce, their records explosive - but their outrageous live shows define them. The drama, the surprise, the danger, the command. From singer Arrow de Wilde’s physical abandon to Henri Cash’s slash ‘n’ burn guitar antics, the LA outfit is a group you need to see in action to fully appreciate. Ozzy Osbourne fiend de Wilde takes her voice to all kinds of places; she's a mesmerizing front person whose vocal attack drags you deeper into Starcrawler's songs. We grabbed ’em up for a DSCVR performance and they really delivered. “Chicken Woman” is a track from their new self-titled album, produced by Ryan Adams (who has said listening to the band is like “being hit by four trains at once.\") Kinda glam, kinda punk, they’ve perfected a way of imploding and exploding at the same time. WITH a sense of humor.  for a glimpse of their don't-care attitude. For a glimpse of their don't-care attitude, check their \"I Love LA\" video, which finds them rocking the hell out of a Silver Lake donut shop. And share \"Chicken Woman\" with a friend. The buzz around Starcrawler is getting louder by the minute. \n\nDirector: Micah Bickham\nProducer: Emily Louick & Contrast Films\n\nSubscribe to dscvr: https://bit.ly/2xmXxcR\n\nWatch Starcrawler music videos - https://bit.ly/2IUNZHu\n\nFollow Vevo \nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\n\nFollow Starcrawler\nhttps://twitter.com/thestarcrawler\nhttps://www.facebook.com/starcrawlert...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/starcrawler","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuwfTjIiDaE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuwfTjIiDaE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuwfTjIiDaE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuwfTjIiDaE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PuwfTjIiDaE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Vevo","playlistId":"LL2pmfLm7iq6Ov1UwYrWYkZA","position":2,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"PuwfTjIiDaE"}},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"PuwfTjIiDaE","videoPublishedAt":"2018-05-29T16:00:01.000Z"}}]});
