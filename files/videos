From singer Arrow de Wilde’s physical abandon to Henri Cash’s slash ‘n’ burn guitar antics, the LA outfit is a group you need to see in action to fully appreciate. Ozzy Osbourne fiend de Wilde takes her voice to all kinds of places; she's a mesmerizing front person whose vocal attack drags you deeper into Starcrawler's songs. We grabbed ’em up for a DSCVR performance and they really delivered. “Chicken Woman” is a track from their new self-titled album, produced by Ryan Adams (who has said listening to the band is like “being hit by four trains at once.\") Kinda glam, kinda punk, they’ve perfected a way of imploding and exploding at the same time.
